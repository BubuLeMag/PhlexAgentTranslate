##Translating individual files
Each file is a JSON file that contains trigger phrases used by API.ai.
For example, the file /entities/Controls_entries_fr.json

It has multiple arrays like so:

    "value": "Resume",
    "synonyms": [
    "Resume",
    "Start",
    "Continue",
    "Resume Playback",
    "Unpause"

**The "value" portion should not change.**

But they synonyms - those need to be translated to french.

So, a translated array may look like this when done:

    "value": "Resume",
    "synonyms": [
    "CV",
    "DÃ©but",
    "Continuer",
    "Reprendre la lecture",
    "Unpause",
    "French-specific phrase meaning 'unpause'"...

Once all arrays are translated, save and commit.
